TSTREAMS library
================

`TSTREAMS` are Common Lisp Gray Streams which perform some
transformation on the data they are reading or writing before passing
the data along to an underlying stream.

Building blocks:

* BINARY-OUTPUT-STREAM => do-something(OUTPUT-STREAM)
* CHARACTER-OUTPUT-STREAM => do-something(OUTPUT-STREAM)

* BINARY-INPUT-STREAM => do-something(INPUT-STREAM)
* CHARACTER-INPUT-STREAM => do-something(INPUT-STREAM)
